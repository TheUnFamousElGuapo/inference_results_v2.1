INSPUR BR104 inference system supports the capability of Access to BIREN GPGPU through RDMA to transfer data directly from PCIe devices (e.g. network, storage or camera) to GPGPU device memory.

One Mellanox ConnectX-6 NIC and one PCIe Gen4 switch is connected to the CPU PCIe root complexes. Four BR104 GPGPUs and one Mellanox ConnectX-6 NIC is connected with the same PCIe Gen4 switch. In total, the system has 2 Mellanox ConnectX-6 NICs with 200Gbps per NIC.

The highest bandwidth requirement for any of INSPURâ€™s submissions is Resnet-50 Offline, which requires 38.89 GB/s per server with four BR104 GPGPU. INSPUR has measured over 41.1 GB/s per server with four GPGPU with BIREN's Access GPGPU through RDMA technology.
