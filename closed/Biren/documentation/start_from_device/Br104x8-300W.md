BIREN BR104 inference system supports the capability of Access to BIREN GPGPU through RDMA to transfer data directly from PCIe devices (e.g. network, storage or camera) to GPGPU device memory.

The eight BR104 GPGPUs in the system are divided symmetrically into two groups, with four GPGPUs in each group. In each group, one Mellanox ConnectX-6 NIC and one PCIe Gen4 switch is connected to the CPU PCIe root complexes. Four BR104 GPGPUs and one Mellanox ConnectX-6 NIC is connected with the same PCIe Gen4 switch. In total, the system has four Mellanox ConnectX-6 NICs with 200Gbps per NIC

The highest bandwidth requirement for any of BIRENâ€™s submissions is Resnet-50 Offline, which requires 77.7GB/s per server with eight BR104 GPGPU. BIREN has measured over 83.4 GB/s per server with eight GPGPU with our Access GPGPU through RDMA technology.
