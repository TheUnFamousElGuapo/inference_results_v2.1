# H3C UniServer R5300 G5 System Architecture

[H3C UniServer R5300 G5](https://www.h3c.com/cn/Products_And_Solution/Server/H3C/Products/RackServer/Products_Series/Application_Optimization_GPU/R5300_G5/) system supports the [GPUDirect](https://developer.nvidia.com/gpudirect) capability of NVIDIA GPUs to transfer data directly from PCIe devices (e.g. network, storage or camera) to GPU device memory. The R5300 G5 has two PCIe-Gen4 switches. Four A100s can be connected under each PCIe-Gen4 switch, which is also connected to a Mellanox CX6 NICs with bandwidth of 200 Gb/s.

The highest bandwidth requirement for any of H3C's submissions is DLRM-Offline which requires 4.34 GB/s. H3C has measured over 5.5 GB/s per GPU. 

The R5300 G5 also supports the NVIDIA A100 4-GPU module, which is switchless. We enabled GPUDirect on ResNet50 and BERT based on H3C's internal bandwidth measurements. The highest bandwidth requirement for any of H3C's submissions is ResNet50-Offline which requires 3.02 GB/s; the system is able to meet this requirement.
